 - total btc value of each order in the buy/sell order books.
 - total sum of each book's btc value.
 - quick access to the value of BTC for all orders above a chosen price level in either order book.
* Listing of all accounts you have at Bittrex and their respective and total  values in BTC and Dollars.

* Listing of your open orders and order history with cancel order option.
 Its just like at the site but you don't need to have a whole web page refresh and leave the trading view.

* A perfect additional tool to the website to maximize your trading abilities and speed.

* Some advanced trader auto and timed functions are available and are unlocked when you have 1200 QTL at your bittrex account (3000 QTL at Bittrex and Poloniex combined for version 2.x).

* Additional features are being added fast.  Update come every 3 day during this early launching period.

* If you don't like Quatloo Trader, It doesn't cost you anything!  It works when you are holding a minimum of 100 QTL (1000 QTL at Bittrex and Poloniex combined for version 2.x).
